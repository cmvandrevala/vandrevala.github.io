### A Short Break

I am finishing up my Ph.D. in physics over the next few months, so I am going to have to take a small break from blogging in order to analyze my data and write my thesis. You might have already noticed that I haven't written a new post in awhile.

Don't despair! Cupcake Physics is still going to be active on social media. And the Cupcake Physics blog will be back in full force this September, followed shortly by the main Cupcake Physics site! Until then, please feel free to peruse any existing content on the blog.
