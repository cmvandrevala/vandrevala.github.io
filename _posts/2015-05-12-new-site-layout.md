### The Cupcake Physics blog just got a makeover!

I am very excited to introduce the new design for the Cupcake Physics blog. I've tidied up the site, reviewed the blog posts, and painted everything with a nice pastel finish. Truly, a website worth sinking your teeth into!

Over the next few months, you will see more updates to the site as I work to improve the Cupcake Physics experience. I am going to improve blog posts with more interactive elements and downloadable content for you to play with!

I also plan to increase the CP ratio of the site dramatically. No, I don't mean the [heat capacity ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity_ratio). I mean the cupcakes per page ratio!

Stay tuned for more physics! And more cupcakes :)
