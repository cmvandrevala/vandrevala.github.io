### It Has Been Awhile!

Hello again everyone - it has been awhile since my last post. Over the past couple of years, I have been working on Cupcake Physics in my spare time. Cupcake Physics is a website that aims to help students practice physics concepts using customizable quizzes and focused feedback. At this point in time I think the site is ready for an initial release. The important infrastructure is in place and there is a small amount of content that has been developed for the site. However, development is by no means over! I hope to keep evolving the site with new content and features that help students learn physics.

Starting today, I will try to write blog posts more consistently and give updates on the new content and features that are being developed for Cupcake Physics. I aim to write one post every two weeks - hopefully announcing it publicly will help keep me motivated! My goal is to create a website that is an excellent resource for those who want to learn physics, but need a different method of instruction than a traditional textbook or lectures.

Your feedback is always appreciated. Please visit [Cupcake Physics](https://cupcakephysics.com) to try the site out. Please send any suggestions for features or content to cyrus.vandrevala@cupcakephysics.com.
