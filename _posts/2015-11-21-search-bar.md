### Search Bar

The blog finally has a search bar! You would think this would be pretty straightforward to implement, but it is a [bit complicated](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10131541/how-can-i-add-a-site-search-feature-to-a-jekyll-blog) when using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). No matter - creating a search bar from scratch means that I can make it a super nice search bar!

Right now, you can do a simple search by post title, description, difficulty, tags, and categories on larger screens. This search bar is going to be expanded with new features over time. I hope that it becomes a sophisticated tool to facilitate your browsing of the Cupcake Physics Blog!
