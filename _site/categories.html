                I am reading a book called Telling Ain't Training, which has given me a lot of great ideas for the site. The cental mantra of "learner centered, performance based" has influenced some of the techniques that I want to use to teach physics.

                Electric Flux, Symmetry, and Gauss's Law
              </h4>

              <p>
                
                
                The nuances of Gauss's law can be rather strange to students who are learning about it for the first time.  I go over some of the properties of the electric flux on a Gaussian surface and why symmetry is so important.

                Green's Function for the Two-Dimensional, Radial Laplacian

                I derive an expression for the Green's function of the two-dimensional, radial Laplacian. Anybody who read my blog post that covered the derivation of the Green's function of the three-dimensional radial Laplacian should notice a large number of similarities between the two derivations.

                This is a simple statics problem that combines free-body diagrams with electric force. It is often the first time that students see concepts from classical mechanics combined with concepts from electromagnetism in a non-trivial way.

                The analysis of the quantum harmonic oscillator usually stops at finding the energy levels. In this post I take the analysis a little further, calculating some of the thermodynamic properties of a quantum harmonic oscillator.

                I derive the relativistic Doppler shift equation in three different ways. The first derivation uses only the definition of time dilation. The second derivation uses a Lorentz boost along the direction of motion. The third derivation uses the general matrix formalism of special relativity.
