### A Bit of Housekeeping

The cupcakes got a splash of color! This week, I went back over some of the old posts in order to add new references and new, colorful pictures. The references should be helpful for reading further into the given physics topic. The diagrams should help take the edge off while solving difficult physics problems :)

Until next week!
