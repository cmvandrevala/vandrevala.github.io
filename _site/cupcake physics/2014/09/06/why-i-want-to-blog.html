      <h3 id="hello-world">Hello World!</h3>

<p>Welcome to my website and blog! I have wanted to create a professional website for awhile now, and I finally got a chance to set it up. At first I thought that it would be enough just to have my resume and curriculum vitae on the site. I have seen many great professional sites that are constructed for job searches and career advancement. However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that a blog would be very useful to me. This blog will accomplish a few things:</p>

<h3 id="it-will-help-me-work-through-problems">It Will Help Me Work Through Problems</h3>

<p>Oftentimes in my work, I find that talking through a problem helps me put everything into context and find a solution. I hope that this blog will give me a place to write out my thoughts and work through any problems that I have. More than that, by taking the extra time to write a post, I hope that I will think about the nuances of the subject and explore the problem more fully. I will try to write posts as I teach myself new concepts or work through difficult problems.</p>

<h3 id="it-will-help-me-teach-my-skills-to-others">It Will Help Me Teach My Skills To Others</h3>

<p>I absolutely love teaching. One of my favorite parts about working at Purdue University is having my own classroom. I love how technology has enabled me to reach audiences all over the world. I have had experience with a numher of online resources including Adobe Connect classrooms, online physics homework sites, online textbooks, and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIOz4UFF7XhpxLoSeihwJTQ">series of YouTube videos</a> that go through common physics recitation problems. This blog will allow me to expand on any educational resources that I develop or come across. I can also use this blog to cover special topics that I want to teach to my peers.</p>

<h3 id="it-will-help-me-meet-others">It Will Help Me Meet Others</h3>

<p>There are so many great resources out on the internet written by people in a variety of backgrounds. After taking in their wisdom for many years, I feel like I am ready to start offering some of my own insights. I hope this blog will allow me to meet other people who share similar interests to me. Part of being an active member of a community is contributing your own ideas and getting feedback on what you do. I think that this blog is a great way to get my thoughts out to the world.</p>

<h3 id="it-will-help-me-advertise-my-projects">It Will Help Me Advertise My Projects</h3>

<p>In the past few years, I have really begun to put my skills to the test. I have completed projects in everything from cooking to coding to science. This blog is a simple way to advertise some of the projects that I am working on and make the resources that I develop available to others. It is also a great stepping point for other people to learn about what I am working on and recommend future steps.</p>

<h3 id="it-will-document-my-work-and-progress">It Will Document My Work and Progress</h3>

<p>I suppose that one of my biggest problems is that I am interested in far to many things. I have a lot of ideas and not nearly enough time to explore them all. I have found that I need a good way of organizing my time due to all of the things that I want to accomplish. Additionally, I need a way to filter projects that are not viable. This blog is a tool that will help me do just that. It will document my progress and help me determine what to work on next. Additionally, it will make sure that I put enough time and energy into whatever I am currently working on.</p>
