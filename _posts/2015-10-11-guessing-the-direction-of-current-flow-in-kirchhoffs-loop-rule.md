title: Guessing the Direction of Current Flow in Kirchhoff's Loop Rule
difficulty: easy
category: [Electromagnetism]
tags: [Common Homework Problem]
description: It is very easy to get your paths and currents mixed up when using Kirchhoff's loop rule. I go through a (very) simple circuit problem and demonstrate how different paths and currents will yield answers with the same magnitude, but different sign.

One of the big stumbling blocks that you might run into when using Kirchhoff's loop rule is not staying consistent with your currents and signs. I have seen lots of people try to "fix" the direction of the current halfway through their analysis, only to end up with the wrong answer. In this video I go through a simple circuit example, demonstrating how you will get the same answer for the current no matter how you set up the problem.
