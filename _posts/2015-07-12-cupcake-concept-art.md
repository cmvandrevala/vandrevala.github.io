### New Concept Art

This weekend has been busy and fun. My wife and I attended a wedding at [Lambeau Field](http://www.packers.com/lambeau-field/) on Saturday, so most of my time has been taken up by celebration and travel. Since I didn't get a chance to write a blog post, I thought that I would introduce some new cupcake concept art.

I have finally reached cupcake critical mass. Starting next week, you will see these little guys throughout the blog posts.
