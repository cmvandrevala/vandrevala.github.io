### My Plans

These past few months have been a whirlwind as I finished up my thesis and ramped up at my new job. All the while I have been eager for the day when I can return to regular updates on this site. The silver lining to this story is that the time off gave me a chance to brainstorm some new ideas for Cupcake Physics and its future directions.

Up until now, I have been writing blog posts that outline a proof or solution to a specific problem. These posts are certainly useful, but I want really dive into physics education; my goal is to provide students and informal learners some tools that they can use to grasp difficult concepts in all levels of physics. Over the next few months, you will see a few changes on this site.

I will separate the physics lessons from site updates. The lessons will be moved to a new webpage and given better organization and search capabilities. I also want to improve the lessons with a healthy dose of interactive Javascript so that learners can play with some simple models rather than just read text on the page.

Stay tuned for more updates!
