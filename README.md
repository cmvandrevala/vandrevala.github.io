# Cupcake Physics Blog

This repo contains the blog for Cupcake Physics. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You can access the site via `blog.cupcakephysics.com`.

## Development

Clone the site using:

```
git clone git@github.com:vandrevala/vandrevala.github.io.git
```

The following command will build the website and put the files in the `_site` directory.

```
jekyll build
```

Alternatively, the following command will start a server that will hot-reload any changes that you make to the project:

```
jekyll serve
```

This server will be available on `localhost:4000`.

## Deployment

Once the site has been built using either of the two methods from above, you can push the project to GitHub. GitHub will automatically deploy any content that is stored on the master branch.
