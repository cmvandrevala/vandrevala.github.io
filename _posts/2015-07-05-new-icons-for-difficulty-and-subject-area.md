### New Icons!

You may have noticed that the blog has gotten more colorful! I have rolled out a set of icons that you can use to quickly identify the difficulty and content of each blog post.

####Difficulty Levels

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Icon</td>
    <td>Difficulty</td>
	<td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/icons/difficulty/easy.png" alt="Easy" style="width: 40px;"/></td>
    <td>Easy</td>
	<td>These posts cover introductory physics topics seen in an upper-level high school or lower-level college course. Depending on the post, you might see a few lines of basic calculus.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/icons/difficulty/medium.png" alt="Medium" style="width: 40px;"/></td>
    <td>Medium</td>
	<td>These posts cover intermediate physics topics that are usually seen by undergraduate physics majors. They include longer derivations and more sophisticated math techniques.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/icons/difficulty/hard.png" alt="Hard" style="width: 40px;"/></td>
    <td>Hard</td>
	<td>These posts cover advanced physics topics that are seen by upper-level undergraduate students and graduate students in physics. This is where I cover some of the difficult theory that physicists have to contend with.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

####Cupcake Physics News

Just to keep announcements clear, I will use the following pink icon to identify Cupcake Physics news and updates.

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">
![Cupcake Physics News]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/icons/topic/cupcake-physics.png)
</div>

Next week, we will get back to physics. See you then!
